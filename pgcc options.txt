DESCRIPTION

       pgcc is the interface to the Portland Group C compiler for
       IA-32  (Intel x86) processors.  It invokes the C compiler,
       assembler, and linker with options derived from  its  com-
       mand line arguments.

       pgcc  bases its processing on the suffixes of the files it
       is passed.  Files whose names end with .c  are  considered
       to be C source files.  They are preprocessed, compiled and
       assembled.  The resulting object file  is  placed  in  the
       current directory.  Files whose names end with .s are con-
       sidered to be IA-32 assembly  language  files.   They  are
       assembled  and  the resulting object file is placed in the
       current directory.  Files whose  names  end  with  .o  are
       taken  as  object  files,  and  are passed directly to the
       linker if linking is requested.   Files  whose  names  end
       with .a are taken as ar libraries.  No action is performed
       on .a files unless  linking  is  requested.   Files  whose
       names  end  with  .f  or  .F  are considered to be Fortran
       source files and are compiled by the Fortran compiler.

       Files not ending in .o, .s, .i, .c,  .f,  .F,  or  .a  are
       taken as object files and passed to the linker (if linking
       is requested) with a warning message.

       If a single C program is compiled and linked with one pgcc
       command,  then  the intermediate object and assembly files
       are deleted.



OPTIONS

       When source files are compiled using any of the  -g,  -mp,
       -Mconcur,  or -Mprof options, the same option(s) should be
       used when using pgcc to link the objects.


       -#        Display the invocations of the compiler,  assem-
                 bler,  and  linker.   These  invocations are the
                 and linker, but do not execute them.

       -B        Allow  C++-style  comments in source code; these
                 begin with  the characters '//' and continue  to
                 the  end of the current line.  Such comments are
                 stripped unless you specify the -C option.

       -C        Preserve  comments  in  preprocessed  C   source
                 files.

       -c        Skip the link step; compile and assemble only.

       -Dname[=def]
                 Define  name  to be def in the preprocessor.  If
                 def is missing, it is assumed to be  empty.   If
                 the  =  sign is missing, then name is defined to
                 be the string 1.

       -dryrun   Use this option to display  the  invocations  of
                 the  compiler,  assembler, and linker but do not
                 execute them.

       -E        Preprocess each .c file and send the  result  to
                 standard  output.   No compilation, assembly, or
                 linking is performed.

       -fast     Chooses generally optimal flags for  the  target
                 platform.     Equivalent    to   "-O2   -Munroll
                 -Mnoframe" on IA-32 platforms.

       -flags    Display  valid  driver  options  and  additional
                 driver help information.

       -fpic     (Linux  and  Solaris86  only) Instructs the com-
                 piler  to  generate  position-independent   code
                 which  can be used to create shared object files
                 (dynamically linked libraries).

       -fPIC     Equivalent to -fpic.  Provided for compatibility
                 with other compilers.

       -G        (Solaris86  only)  Passed  to linker.  Instructs
                 the  linker  to  create  a  shared  object  file
                 (dynamically linked library).

       -g        Generate  symbolic debug information.  This also
                 sets the optimization level to zero, unless a -O
                 switch is present on the command line.  Symbolic
                 debugging may give confusing results if an opti-
                 mization  level  other  than  zero  is selected.
                 Using -O0 the generated code will be slower than
                 code generated at other optimization levels.
                 standard output.

       -Idirectory
                 Add directory to the compiler's search path  for
                 include  files.  For include files surrounded by
                 < >, each -I directory is searched  followed  by
                 the standard area.  For include files surrounded
                 by " ", the directory containing the  file  con-
                 taining the #include directive is searched, fol-
                 lowed by the -I  directories,  followed  by  the
                 standard area.

       -Kflag    Requests  that the compiler provide special com-
                 pilation semantics.  The permitted flags are:

                 ieee      Perform float and  double  divides  in
                           conformance  with  the  IEEE 754 stan-
                           dard.  This is done by  replacing  the
                           usual  in-line divide algorithm with a
                           subroutine call,  at  the  expense  of
                           performance.   The  default  algorithm
                           produces results that differ from  the
                           correctly  rounded  result  by no more
                           than 3 units in the last place.  Also,
                           on  some systems, a more accurate math
                           library may be  linked  if  -Kieee  is
                           used during the link step.

                 noieee    Use the in-line divide algorithm, link
                           in the non-IEEE  libraries  if  avail-
                           able, and disable underflow traps.

                 PIC       Equivalent  to  -fpic.   Provided  for
                           compatibility with other compilers.

                 pic       Equivalent  to  -fpic.   Provided  for
                           compatibility with other compilers.

                 trap=option[,option]...
                           Controls  the  behavior  of  the IA-32
                           processor  when  IA-32  floating-point
                           exceptions  occur.   Possible  options
                           include  fp,  align  (ignored),   inv,
                           denorm,  divz,  ovf, unf, and inexact.
                           -Ktrap is only processed when  compil-
                           ing   a  main  function/program.   The
                           options inv, denorm, divz,  ovf,  unf,
                           and  inexzct  correspond  to the IA-32
                           processor's   exception   mask    bits
                           invalid     operation,    denormalized
                           operand,   divide-by-zero,   overflow,
                           underflow,   and   precision,  respec-
                           (floating-point exceptions are  masked
                           -  the  processor recovers from excep-
                           tions and continues).  If a  floating-
                           point  exception occurs and its corre-
                           sponding   mask   bit   is   off   (or
                           "unmasked"), execution terminates with
                           an arithmetic exception (C's FPE  sig-
                           nal).    -Ktrap=fp  is  equivalent  to
                           -Ktrap=inv,divz,ovf.

       -Ldirectory
                 Change the default directory in which the linker
                 searches  for  libraries  to  directory.  If the
                 linker supports this option, then the option  is
                 passed  to  the  linker;  otherwise,  the driver
                 replaces the default library area with directory
                 and  uses  it  when  constructing  library  path
                 names.  Note that a library search path  can  be
                 established using this option only if the linker
                 supports such functionality.

       -llibrary Load the library liblibrary.a from the  standard
                 library  directory.  If the linker supports this
                 option; then the option is passed to the linker.
                 The  library  name  is  constructed and the full
                 library path is passed to the linker.   See  the
                 -L option above.

       -M        Generate  a  list  of make dependences and print
                 them to stdout.

       -MD       Generate a list of make  dependences  and  print
                 them  to the file file.d, where file is the root
                 name of the file under compilation.

       -Mpgflag  See the description for the -Mpgflag options  on
                 the following pages.

       -m        Display a link map on the standard output.

       -mp       Interpret OpenMP pragmas to explicitly parallel-
                 ize  regions  of  code for execution by multiple 
                 threads on a multi-processor system. Most OpenMP
                 pragmas  as  well as SGI parallelization pragmas
                 are supported.  See Chapter 11 of the PGI User's 
                 Guide for more information on these pragmas.

       -O[level] Set the optimization level.  If -O is not speci-
                 fied, then the default level is 1 if -g  is  not
                 specified,  and 0 if -g is specified.  If a num-
                 ber is not supplied with -O then  the  optimiza-

                 0         A basic block is generated for each  C
                           statement.    No  scheduling  is  done
                           between statements.  No  global  opti-
                           mizations are performed.

                 1         Scheduling   within   extended   basic
                           blocks is  performed.   Some  register
                           allocation  is  performed.   No global
                           optimizations are performed.

                 2         All level  1  optimizations  are  per-
                           formed.    In   addition,  traditional
                           scalar optimizations such as induction
                           recognition  and loop invariant motion
                           are performed by the global optimizer.

       -o file   Use  file as the name of the executable program,
                 rather then the default a.out.

       -P        Preprocess each file and leave the output  in  a
                 file named file.i for each file named file.c.

       -pc       The  IA-32  architecture  implements a floating-
                 point stack using 8 80-bit registers. Each  reg-
                 ister  uses  bits  0-63 as the significand, bits
                 64-78 for the exponent, and bit 79 is  the  sign
                 bit. This 80-bit real format is the default for-
                 mat (called the extended format).   When  values
                 are  loaded  into  the floating point stack they
                 are automatically converted into  extended  real
                 format.   The  precision  of  the floating point
                 stack can be controlled, however, by setting the
                 precision  control  bits  (bits  8 and 9) of the
                 floating control  word  appropriately.  In  this
                 way,  the programmer can explicitly set the pre-
                 cision to standard IEEE double  using  64  bits,
                 or  to  single  precision  using  32  bits.  The
                 default precision setting is  system  dependent.
                 If  you  use  -pc to alter the precision setting
                 for a routine, the main program must be compiled
                 with  the  same value for -pc.  The command line
                 option -pc val lets the programmer set the  com-
                 piler's  precision  preference. Valid values for
                 val are:
                     32      single precision
                     64      double precision
                     80      extended precision
                 Operations performed exclusively on the floating
                 point  stack  using  extended precision, without
                 storing into or loading from memory,  can  cause
                 problems  with  accumulated  values  within  the
                 not match expected results.

       -Rdirectory
                 (Linux and Solaris86 only) Passed to the linker;
                 always  search directory for shared object files
                 when running the generated executable.

       -r        Passed to the  linker;  generate  a  re-linkable
                 object file.

       -rc rcfile
                 Specifies  the name of a driver startup configu-
                 ration file.  If rcfile is a full pathname, then
                 use the specified file.  If rcfile is a relative
                 pathname, use the file name as found in  in  the
                 $DRIVER directory.

       -S        Skip  the  assembly  and  link steps.  Leave the
                 output from the compile step  in  a  file  named
                 file.s for each file named file.c or file.f.

       -s        Passed  to the linker; strip symbol table infor-
                 mation.

       -shared   (Linux only) Passed to  the  linker.   Instructs
                 the  linker  to  generate  a  shared object file
                 (dynamically linked library).

       -show     Produce driver help information  describing  the
                 current driver configuration.

       -time     Print  execution  times for the various compila-
                 tion steps.

       -tp       Specify the type of the target processor; possi-
                 bilities  are  -tp p5 for Pentium processors and
                 -tp p6 for Pentium Pro or Pentium II processors.
                 The default in the absence of the -tp flag is to
                 compile for the type of CPU on  which  the  com-
                 piler is running.

       -Uname    Remove  any  initial  definition  of name in the
                 preprocessor.  The only names predefined by  the
                 preprocessor itself are the standard ANSI C pre-
                 defined macros.  The driver may predefine  other
                 names  (see  the  following  description for the
                 -Mnostddef option).  Since all  -D  options  are
                 processed  before  all -U options, the -U option
                 override -D options.  NOTE:  ANSI  C  predefined
                 macros  can be defined and undefined on the com-
                 mand line, but not with  #define  and  #undefine
                 directives in the source.
                 ence.

       -V        Display version messages and other  information.

       -v        Verbose  mode.   Print  out the command line for
                 each tool before it is executed.

       -Wpass,option[,option...]
                 Pass the options to the  specified  pass.   Each
                 comma-delimited  option  is passed as a separate
                 argument.  The passes are: 0 for the compiler, a
                 for the assembler, and l for the linker.

       -w        Do not print warning messages.

       -Xlevel   Specify  the  degree of ANSI C conformance.  The
                 level argument can be either a or c { a | c }.

                 a    Use ANSI mode.  The compiled language  con-
                      forms to all new ANSI features.

                 c    Use  the  conformance  mode.   The compiled
                      language conforms to ANSI C,  but  warnings
                      may be produced about some extensions.

                 s    The compiled language conforms to K&R C.

                 t    The  compiled  language  conforms to K&R C.
                      The  compiler  may  produce  warnings   for
                      semantics  where ANSI C and K&R C conflict.

       -Ypass,directory
                 Look in directory for pass pass, rather then  in
                 the standard area.  The passes are:

                 0         Search   for  the  pgc  executable  in
                           directory.

                 a         Search for the assembler executable in
                           directory.

                 l         Search  for  the  linker executable in
                           directory.

                 S
                           Search for the startup object files in
                           directory.

                 L         If the linker supports the -YL option,
                           then pass the option -YL,directory  to
                           the  linker.  Otherwise, use directory
                           as the standard library location.
                           then  pass the option -YU,directory to
                           the linker.  Otherwise this option  is
                           ignored.

                 I         Set  the  compiler's  standard include
                           directory to directory.  The  standard
                           include  directory is set to a default
                           value by the driver and can  be  over-
                           ridden by this option.

       -y        Arguments are passed to the linker.

       -Mpgflag  Request  PGI-specific actions from the compiler.
                 Many of pgflags optionally begin with  no  (e.g.
                 [no]list).   If the default of such an option is
                 the no variant, this is indicated by no  appear-
                 ing in bold italics as in [nnoo]list.  The permit-
                 ted pgflags are:

                           assembly language.   -Mkeepasm  or  -S
                           must be used as well.

                           source   code.    The    format    is:
                           asm("<text>")

                 [no]bounds
                           Enable  (disable)  array bounds check-
                           ing.  Bounds checking is  not  applied
                           to a subscripting pointer.

                 [no]builtin
                           (Don't)  Do  compile with math subrou-
                           tine  builtin  support,  which  causes
                           selected  math  library routines to be
                           inlined.

                 cache_align

                           on cache-line  boundaries.   An uncon-
                           strained object is a variable or array
                           that  is  not a member of an aggregate
                           structure  or  common  block,  is  not
                           allocatable,  and is not an automatic
                           array.

                           function  and  after  returning from a
                           function  or  subroutine call.  If the
                           PGI_CONTINUE  environment  variable is
                           set,  the  stack will be automatically
                           cleaned  up and execution will contin-
                           ue.  There  is  a  performance penalty
                           associated  with  stack  cleanup.   If
                           PGI_CONTINUE  is  set  to verbose, the
                           stack will be automatically cleaned up
                           and  execution  will  continue after a
                           warning message is printed.

                 chkstk    Check  the  stack  for available space
                           upon entry to and before the start  of
                           a  parallel  region.  Useful when many

                           parallelizable.    When  linking,  the
                           -Mconcur switch must be  specified  or
                           unresolved references will occur.  The
                           NCPUS  environment  variable  controls
                           how  many  processors  will be used to
                           execute   parallelized   loops.    The
                           options can be one or more of the fol-
                           lowing:

                           altcode[:n]
                                     Instructs  the  parallelizer
                                     to generate alternate scalar
                                     code for parallelized loops.
                                     If   altcode   is  specified
                                     without arguments, the  par-
                                     allelizer    determines   an
                                     appropriate  cutoff   length
                                     and generates scalar code to
                                     be  executed  whenever   the
                                     loop  count  is less than or
                                     equal to  that  length.   If
                                     altcode:n  is specified, the
                                     scalar altcode  is  executed
                                     whenever  the  loop count is
                                     less than or equal to n.

                           noaltcode If noaltcode  is  specified,
                                     the  parallelized version of
                                     the loop is always  executed
                                     regardless   of   the   loop
                                     count.

                           dist:block

                                     blocks of  iterations  of  a
                                     parallelizable    loop   are
                                     assigned  to  the  available
                                     processors.

                           dist:cyclic
                                     Parallelize with cyclic dis-

                                     loop nest  is  parallelized.
                                     If  a  parallelized  loop is
                                     innermost,  its   iterations
                                     are  allocated to processors
                                     cyclically.  For example, if
                                     there  are 3 processors exe-
                                     etc;  processor  1  performs
                                     iterations  1,  4,  7,  etc;
                                     and  processor  2   performs
                                     iterations 2, 5, 8, etc.

                           cncall    Loops  containing  calls are
                                     safe to parallelize.   Also,
                                     no    minimum   loop   count
                                     threshold must be  satisfied
                                     before  parallelization will
                                     occur, and  last  values  of
                                     scalars  are  assumed  to be
                                     safe.

                 dollar,char
                           Set the character used to replace dol-
                           lar   signs   in  names  to  be  char.
                           Default is an underscore (_).

                 extract[=option[,option,...]]
                           Pass options to the  function  extrac-
                           tor.   The  -o filename option must be
                           used  with  this  switch  to  name   a
                           library.

                           [name:]function
                                     A   non-numeric  option  not
                                     containing   a   period   is
                                     assumed  to  be  a  function
                                     name.  The named function is
                                     extracted.    If   name:  is
                                     specified, what  follows  is
                                     always  the  name of a func-
                                     tion.


                                     A numeric option is  assumed
                                     to  be  a  size.   Functions
                                     containing  number  or  less
                                     statements   are  extracted.
                                     If both number and  function
                                     are  specified,  then  func-

                                     (inform,  warn,  severe  and
                                     fatal).

                 inline[=option[,option,...]]
                           Pass  options to the function inliner.
                           The options are:

                           [lib:]filename.ext
                                     An   option   containing   a
                                     period  is  assumed to be an
                                     inline library created by  a
                                     previous  -Mextract  option.
                                     If  lib:  is  specified,  no
                                     period  is necessary.  Func-
                                     tions  from  the   specified
                                     library  are inlined.  If no
                                     library is specified,  func-
                                     tions  are  extracted from a
                                     temporary  library   created
                                     during an extract prepass.

                           [name:]function
                                     A   non-numeric  option  not
                                     containing   a   period   is
                                     assumed  to  be  a  function
                                     name.  If  name:  is  speci-
                                     fied, what follows is always
                                     the name of a function.

                           [size:]number
                                     A numeric option is  assumed
                                     to  be  a  size.   Functions
                                     containing  number  or  less
                                     statements  are inlined.  If
                                     both number and function are
                                     specified,   then  functions
                                     matching the  given  name(s)
                                     or meeting the size require-
                                     ments, are inlined.

                           levels:number
                                     number of levels of inlining
                                     are  performed.  The default
                                     is 1.

                 keepasm   Keep the  assembly  file  for  each  C
                           source  file, but continue to assemble
                           and link the program.  This is  mainly
                           for use in compiler performance analy-
                           sis and debugging.

                 neginfo=option[,option]...
                           Instructs  the  compiler  to   produce
                           information  on  why certain optimiza-
                           tions  are  not  performed.   Possible
                           value  for  option  include concur and
                           loop.

                 noframe   Eliminate operations  that  set  up  a
                           true  stack  frame  pointer  for func-
                           tions.

                 noopenmp  When the option -mp is present, ignore
                           the OpenMP pragmas.

                 nosgimp   When the option -mp is present, ignore
                           the SGI parallelization pragmas.

                 nostddef  Do not predefine  any  macros  to  the
                           preprocessor  when  compiling a C pro-
                           gram.  The normal predefined macro is:
                           -Dunix.

                 nostdinc  Do not search in the standard location
                           for include files when those files are
                           not found elsewhere.

                 nostdlib  Do  not link in the standard libraries
                           when linking a program.

                 nostartup Do not link in the usual startup  rou-
                           tine.  This routine contains the entry
                           point for the program.

                 prof[=option[,option,...]]
                           Set profile options. Normally, the  -q
                           or -p switches are used for this; how-
                           ever, on some systems, it is desirable
                           to override the default method of pro-
                           filing.  See the PGI profiler  manual,
                           or  the  system  profiler  manual, for
                           further information.

                           func      Perform  PGI-style  function
                                     level profiling.

                           lines     Perform PGI-style line level
                                     profiling.

                           mcount    Perform function level  pro-
                                     filing.

                 safe_lastval
                           In  the  case  where  a scalar is used
                           after a loop, but is  not  defined  on
                           every  iteration of the loop, the com-
                           piler does not by default  parallelize
                           the  loop.  However, this option tells

                 safeptr[=option[,option,...]]
                           Override  data  dependence  between  C
                           pointers and arrays.  This option must
                           be  used with care since the potential
                           exists for code to be  generated  that
                           will result in unexpected or incorrect
                           results as is defined by ANSI C.  How-
                           ever,  when used properly, this option
                           has the potential to  greatly  enhance
                           the  performance  of  code, especially
                           floating point oriented loops.  Combi-
                           nations of the options may be used and
                           interact appropriately.

                           dummy | arg
                                     C dummy arguments  (pointers
                                     and arrays) are treated with
                                     the   same    copyin/copyout
                                     semantics  as  Fortran dummy
                                     arguments.

                           auto      C local  or  auto  variables
                                     (pointers  and  arrays)  are
                                     assumed not  to  overlap  or
                                     conflict   with  other  data
                                     objects and are independent.

                           static    C static variables (pointers
                                     and arrays) are assumed  not
                                     to  overlap or conflict with
                                     other data objects  and  are
                                     independent.

                           global    C global or extern variables
                                     (pointers  and  arrays)  are
                                     assumed  not  to  overlap or
                                     conflict  with  other   data
                                     objects and are independent.

                 schar     Specify signed char characters.   Also
                           see the -Muchar option.

                 [no]single
                           (Don't)  suppress  the  ANSI-specified
                           conversion of  float  to  double  when
                           passing  arguments  to a function with
                           no prototype in scope.   -Msingle  may
                           result in faster code when single pre-
                           cision is used a lot, but is  non-ANSI
                           compliant.

                           (Don't)  sign  extend when a narrowing
                           conversion  overflows.   For  example,
                           when  -Msignextend is in effect and an
                           integer containing the value 65535  is
                           converted to a short, the value of the
                           short will be -1.  This option is pro-
                           vided  for  compatibility  with  other
                           compilers, even though ANSI  C  speci-
                           fies  that  the result of such conver-
                           sions are undefined.  -Msignextend  is
                           the default.

                 uchar     Treat   plain   char  declarations  as
                           unsigned char declarations.  Also  see
                           the -Mschar option.

                 unroll[=option [,option...]]
                           Invokes  the loop unroller.  This also
                           sets the optimization level  to  2  if
                           the  level is set to less than 2.  The
                           option is one of the following:

                           c:m       Instructs  the  compiler  to
                                     completely unroll loops with
                                     a constant loop  count  less
                                     than  or  equal to m, a sup-
                                     plied  constant.   If   this
                                     value is not supplied, the m
                                     count is set to 4.

                           n:u       instructs  the  compiler  to
                                     unroll u times, a loop which
                                     is not completely  unrolled,
                                     or  has  a non-constant loop
                                     count.  If  u  is  not  sup-
                                     plied, the unroller computes
                                     the number of times a candi-
                                     date loop is unrolled.

                 nounroll  Instructs  the  compiler not to unroll
                           loops.

                 vect[=option[,option,...]]
                           Pass options to the  internal  vector-
                           izer.  If no option list is specified,
                           then the  following  vector  optimiza-
                           tions     are    used:    assoc,cache-
                           size:262144.  The vect options are:

                           assoc     Instructs the vectorizer  to
                                     enable certain associativity
                                     conversions that can  change

                                     round-off error.

                           noassoc   Instructs  the vectorizer to

                                     Instructs   the  vectorizer,
                                     when performing cache tiling
                                     optimizations,  to  assume a
                                     cache size of number.

                           sse       Instructs  the vectorizer to
                                     search  for loops, and where
                                     possible,  generate calls to

DIAGNOSTICS

       The compiler produces information and error messages as it
       translates  the  input  program.  The linker and assembler
       may issue their own error messages.
