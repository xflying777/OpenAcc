DESCRIPTION


       pgCC is the interface to the Portland Group  C++  compiler 
       for IA-32  (Intel x86) processors.   It  invokes  the  C++
       compiler, assembler, and linker with options derived  from  
       its  command-line arguments.

       pgCC  bases its processing on the suffixes of the files it
       is passed.  Files whose names end with .cpp, .cc, .c or .C  
       are  considered to be C++ source files.   They are prepro-
       cessed, compiled and assembled.  The resulting object file
       is placed in the current directory.  Files whose names end 
       with .s are  considered  IA-32  assembly  language  files.   
       They are assembled and the resulting object file is placed
       in the current directory.  Files whose names end  with  .o  
       are taken as object files, and  are passed directly to the
       linker if linking is requested.   Files  whose  names  end
       with .a are taken as ar libraries.  No action is performed
       on .a files unless  linking  is  requested.

       Files not ending in .o, .s, .i, .c, .cpp,  .cc,  .C or  .a
       are  taken  as object files and  passed  to the linker (if
       linking is requested) with a warning message.

       If a single C++ program is compiled and  linked  with  one 
       pgCC command, then the intermediate  object  and  assembly 
       files are deleted.



A NOTE ON C++ OPTIMIZATION



       pgCC provides a number of options to enable different opt-
       imization  levels.   PGI recommends the following switches
       as a starting point for setting the optimization level: 

             -fast -Minline=levels:10.  

       The best performance is achieved if exception handling  is 
       also disabled via --no_exceptions. To avoid excessive code 
       expansion due to inlining, move Standard Template  Library 
       I/O out of inlined objects.  For additional  optimizations, 
       refer to the -Msafeptr and -Mvect options.



OPTIONS

       When source files are compiled using any of the  -g,  -mp,
       -Mconcur,  or -Mprof options, the same option(s) should be
       used when using pgCC to link the objects.


       -#        Display the invocations of the compiler,  assem-
                 bler,  and  linker.   These  invocations are the
                 and linker, but do not execute them.

       -A        With this option, pgCC accepts  code  conforming
                 to the ANSI standard for C++.

       --alternative_tokens
                 (Disable)   Enable  recognition  of  alternative 
                 tokens. This controls recognition of the digraph 
                 tokens in C and C++, and controls recognition of 
                 the operator keywords (e.g., and) in C++.

       -B        Allow  C++-style  comments in source code; these
                 begin with  the characters '//' and continue  to
                 the  end of the current line.  Such comments are
                 stripped unless you specify the -C option.

       --[no_]bool
                 (Disable) Enable recognition of the bool type.

       --[no]builtin
                 (Don't) compile  with  math  subroutine  builtin 
                 support, inling selected math library  routines.  
                 --builtin is the default.

       -C        Preserve  comments  in  preprocessed  C   source
                 files.

       -c        Skip the link step; compile and assemble only.

       --cfront_2.1 
                 Enable  compilation  of  C++   with   cfront 2.1 
                 compatibility.    This  causes  pgCC  to  accept 
                 language constructs that while  not part of  the 
                 C++  language definition,  are  accepted  by the 
                 AT&T C++ language system  (cfront  release 2.1).  
                 Also enables acceptance of anachronisms.

       --cfront_3.0 
                 Enable  compilation  of  C++   with   cfront 3.0
                 compatibility.    This  causes  pgCC  to  accept 
                 language constructs that while  not part of  the 
                 C++  language definition,  are  accepted  by the 
                 AT&T C++ language system  (cfront  release 3.0).  
                 Also enables acceptance of anachronisms.

       --create_pch filename
                 If other conditions are satisfied, create a pre-
                 compiled header file with the specified name. If 
                 --pch   (automatic  PCH  mode)  appears  on  the 
                 command  line following this option,  its effect 
                 is erased.

       -Dname[=def]
                 Define  name  to be def in the preprocessor.  If
                 def is missing, it is assumed to be  empty.   If
                 the  =  sign is missing, then name is defined to
                 be the string 1.

       --diag_error iag,iag,...
                 Override  the  normal  error  severity  of   the 
                 specified diagnostic messages.   The  message(s) 
                 may be specified using amnemonic error tag or an 
                 error number.

       --diag_remark iag,iag,...
                 Override  the  normal  error  severity  of   the 
                 specified diagnostic messages.   The  message(s) 
                 may be specified using amnemonic error tag or an 
                 error number.

       --diag_suppress iag,iag,...
                 Override  the  normal  error  severity  of   the 
                 specified diagnostic messages.   The  message(s) 
                 may be specified using amnemonic error tag or an 
                 error number.

       --diag_warning iag,iag,...
                 Override  the  normal  error  severity  of   the 
                 specified diagnostic messages.   The  message(s) 
                 may be specified using amnemonic error tag or an 
                 error number.

       --display_error_number
                 Display the error message number  in  any  diag-
                 nostic messages that are generated.  The  option 
                 may be used to determine the error number to  be
                 used to override the severity  of  a  diagnostic
                 message.

       --dollar  Accept dollar signs ($) in identifiers.

       -dryrun   Use this option to display  the  invocations  of
                 the  compiler,  assembler, and linker but do not
                 execute them.

       -E        Preprocess each .c file and send the  result  to
                 standard  output.   No compilation, assembly, or
                 linking is performed.

       -e number
                 Set   the  C++  front-end  error  limit  to  the 
                 specified number.  The C++ compiler will abandon
                 compilation after the specified number of errors.

       --[no_]exceptions
                 (Disable)  enable  exception  handling  support.
                 --exceptions is the default.

       -fast     Chooses generally optimal flags for  the  target
                 platform.     Equivalent    to   "-O2   -Munroll
                 -Mnoframe" on IA-32 platforms.

       -flags    Display  valid  driver  options  and  additional
                 driver help information.

       -fpic     (Linux  and  Solaris86  only) Instructs the com-
                 piler  to  generate  position-independent   code
                 which  can be used to create shared object files
                 (dynamically linked libraries).

       -fPIC     Equivalent to -fpic.  Provided for compatibility
                 with other compilers.

       -G        (Solaris86  only)  Passed  to linker.  Instructs
                 the  linker  to  create  a  shared  object  file
                 (dynamically linked library).

       -g        Generate  symbolic debug information.  This also
                 sets the optimization level to zero, unless a -O
                 switch is present on the command line.  Symbolic
                 debugging may give confusing results if an opti-
                 mization  level  other  than  zero  is selected.
                 Using -O0 the generated code will be slower than
                 code generated at other optimization levels.
                 standard output.

       --gnu_extensions
                 Allow GNU extensions like "include_next",  which 
                 are  required  to compile  Linux  system  header 
                 files.  This is the default on Linux systems.

       -Idirectory
                 Add directory to the compiler's search path  for
                 include  files.  For include files surrounded by
                 < >, each -I directory is searched  followed  by
                 the standard area.  For include files surrounded
                 by " ", the directory containing the  file  con-
                 taining the #include directive is searched, fol-
                 lowed by the -I  directories,  followed  by  the
                 standard area.

       --instantiation_dir directory
                 When   --one_instantiation_per_object  is  used, 
                 this  defines  directory  as  the  instantiation 
                 directory.  The default name is template.dir.

       -Kflag    Requests  that the compiler provide special com-
                 pilation semantics.  The permitted flags are:

                 ieee      Perform float and  double  divides  in
                           conformance  with  the  IEEE 754 stan-
                           dard.  This is done by  replacing  the
                           usual  in-line divide algorithm with a
                           subroutine call,  at  the  expense  of
                           performance.   The  default  algorithm
                           produces results that differ from  the
                           correctly  rounded  result  by no more
                           than 3 units in the last place.  Also,
                           on  some systems, a more accurate math
                           library may be  linked  if  -Kieee  is
                           used during the link step.

                 noieee    Use the in-line divide algorithm, link
                           in the non-IEEE  libraries  if  avail-
                           able, and disable underflow traps.

                 PIC       Equivalent  to  -fpic.   Provided  for
                           compatibility with other compilers.

                 pic       Equivalent  to  -fpic.   Provided  for
                           compatibility with other compilers.

                 trap=option[,option]...
                           Controls  the  behavior  of  the IA-32
                           processor  when  IA-32  floating-point
                           exceptions  occur.   Possible  options
                           include  fp,  align  (ignored),   inv,
                           denorm,  divz,  ovf, unf, and inexact.
                           -Ktrap is only processed when  compil-
                           ing   a  main  function/program.   The
                           options inv, denorm, divz,  ovf,  unf,
                           and  inexzct  correspond  to the IA-32
                           processor's   exception   mask    bits
                           invalid     operation,    denormalized
                           operand,   divide-by-zero,   overflow,
                           underflow,   and   precision,  respec-
                           (floating-point exceptions are  masked
                           -  the  processor recovers from excep-
                           tions and continues).  If a  floating-
                           point  exception occurs and its corre-
                           sponding   mask   bit   is   off   (or
                           "unmasked"), execution terminates with
                           an arithmetic exception (C's FPE  sig-
                           nal).    -Ktrap=fp  is  equivalent  to
                           -Ktrap=inv,divz,ovf.

       -Ldirectory
                 Change the default directory in which the linker
                 searches  for  libraries  to  directory.  If the
                 linker supports this option, then the option  is
                 passed  to  the  linker;  otherwise,  the driver
                 replaces the default library area with directory
                 and  uses  it  when  constructing  library  path
                 names.  Note that a library search path  can  be
                 established using this option only if the linker
                 supports such functionality.

       -llibrary Load the library liblibrary.a from the  standard
                 library  directory.  If the linker supports this
                 option; then the option is passed to the linker.
                 The  library  name  is  constructed and the full
                 library path is passed to the linker.   See  the
                 -L option above.

       --[no]llalign
                 (Don't)  Do align long long integers  on  64-bit
                 boundaries.

       -M        Generate  a  list  of make dependences and print
                 them to stdout.

       -MD       Generate a list of make  dependences  and  print
                 them  to the file file.d, where file is the root
                 name of the file under compilation.

       -Mpgflag  See the description for the -Mpgflag options  on
                 the following pages.

       -m        Display a link map on the standard output.

       -mp       Interpret OpenMP pragmas to explicitly parallel-
                 ize  regions  of  code for execution by multiple 
                 threads on a multi-processor system. Most OpenMP
                 pragmas  as  well as SGI parallelization pragmas
                 are supported.  See Chapter 11 of the PGI User's 
                 Guide for more information on these pragmas.

       --no_implicit_include
                 By default,  if the compiler needs a  definition 
                 of a template  declared in a  .h file,  it  will 
                 look  to  the  corresponding  .c  file  for  the 
                 template  definition.    This  flag  turns  that 
                 feature off.

       -O[level] Set the optimization level.  If -O is not speci-
                 fied, then the default level is 1 if -g  is  not
                 specified,  and 0 if -g is specified.  If a num-
                 ber is not supplied with -O then  the  optimiza-

                 0         A basic block is generated for each  C
                           statement.    No  scheduling  is  done
                           between statements.  No  global  opti-
                           mizations are performed.

                 1         Scheduling   within   extended   basic
                           blocks is  performed.   Some  register
                           allocation  is  performed.   No global
                           optimizations are performed.

                 2         All level  1  optimizations  are  per-
                           formed.    In   addition,  traditional
                           scalar optimizations such as induction
                           recognition  and loop invariant motion
                           are performed by the global optimizer.

       -o file   Use  file as the name of the executable program,
                 rather then the default a.out.

       --one_instantiation_per_object
                 Put out each template instantiation (function or
                 static data member) in a separate  object  file.  
                 The primary object file contains everything else 
                 in the compilation.  Having  each  instantiation 
                 in a separate object file is  very  useful  when 
                 creating libraries, because it allows  the  user 
                 of the library to pull only  the  instantiations 
                 that are needed.  This  flag  is  necessary  for 
                 template libraries that rely on  other  template 
                 libraries.

       -P        Preprocess each file and leave the output  in  a
                 file named file.i for each file named file.c.

       +p        Disallow ananchronistic constructs.  Ordinarily,
                 the  C++  front-end  warns  about  anachronistic 
                 constructs;   using  the  +p option the compiler 
                 will  not compile code  containing anachronistic 
                 constructs.

       -pc       The  IA-32  architecture  implements a floating-
                 point stack using 8 80-bit registers. Each  reg-
                 ister  uses  bits  0-63 as the significand, bits
                 64-78 for the exponent, and bit 79 is  the  sign
                 bit. This 80-bit real format is the default for-
                 mat (called the extended format).   When  values
                 are  loaded  into  the floating point stack they
                 are automatically converted into  extended  real
                 format.   The  precision  of  the floating point
                 stack can be controlled, however, by setting the
                 precision  control  bits  (bits  8 and 9) of the
                 floating control  word  appropriately.  In  this
                 way,  the programmer can explicitly set the pre-
                 cision to standard IEEE double  using  64  bits,
                 or  to  single  precision  using  32  bits.  The
                 default precision setting is  system  dependent.
                 If  you  use  -pc to alter the precision setting
                 for a routine, the main program must be compiled
                 with  the  same value for -pc.  The command line
                 option -pc val lets the programmer set the  com-
                 piler's  precision  preference. Valid values for
                 val are:
                     32      single precision
                     64      double precision
                     80      extended precision
                 Operations performed exclusively on the floating
                 point  stack  using  extended precision, without
                 storing into or loading from memory,  can  cause
                 problems  with  accumulated  values  within  the
                 not match expected results.

       --pch     Automatically use and/or  create a  pre-compiled 
                 header  file.    If   --use_pch or  --create_pch 
                 (manual  PCH  mode)  appears on the command-line 
                 following this option, its effect is erased.

       --pch_dir directory
                 The  directory  in which to  search  for  and/or
                 create a pre-compiled header file.   This option
                 may be  used with automatic PCH mode  (--pch) or
                 manual PCH mode (--create_pch or --use_pch).
                 
       --[no]pch_messages
                 (Disable)   Enable  the  display  of  a  message 
                 indicating  that a  pre-compiled header file was
                 created or used in the current compilation.
                 
       --prelink_objects
                 When  used with  --one_instantiation_per_object,
                 creates  template  instantiations  for a  set of 
                 objects  that  are  about to  become  a template
                 library. This is required for template libraries
                 that reference other template libraries.
                 
       -Rdirectory
                 (Linux and Solaris86 only) Passed to the linker;
                 always  search directory for shared object files
                 when running the generated executable.

       -r        Passed to the  linker;  generate  a  re-linkable
                 object file.

       -rc rcfile
                 Specifies  the name of a driver startup configu-
                 ration file.  If rcfile is a full pathname, then
                 use the specified file.  If rcfile is a relative
                 pathname, use the file name as found in  in  the
                 $DRIVER directory.

       -S        Skip  the  assembly  and  link steps.  Leave the
                 output from the compile step  in  a  file  named
                 file.s for each file named file.c or file.f.

       -s        Passed  to the linker; strip symbol table infor-
                 mation.

       -shared   (Linux only) Passed to  the  linker.   Instructs
                 the  linker  to  generate  a  shared object file
                 (dynamically linked library).

       -show     Produce driver help information  describing  the
                 current driver configuration.

       -t arg    Control instantiation of template functions. The
                 argument can be: all, none, local, or used.

                 all       Specifies  that all template functions
                           are instantiated whether or  not  they 
                           are used.

                 none      Specifies  that no  template functions 
                           are instantiated.

                 local     Specifies that only functions that are
                           used in compilation are  instantiated,
                           and they are forced to be local. NOTE:
                           This  may  cause  multiple  copies  of 
                           local static variables. If this occurs, 
                           the program may not execute correctly.

                 used      Specifies that only functions that are
                           used in compilation are instantiated.

       -time     Print  execution  times for the various compila-
                 tion steps.

       -tp       Specify the type of the target processor; possi-
                 bilities  are  -tp p5 for Pentium processors and
                 -tp p6 for Pentium Pro or Pentium II processors.
                 The default in the absence of the -tp flag is to
                 compile for the type of CPU on  which  the  com-
                 piler is running.

       -Uname    Remove  any  initial  definition  of name in the
                 preprocessor.  The only names predefined by  the
                 preprocessor itself are the standard ANSI C pre-
                 defined macros.  The driver may predefine  other
                 names  (see  the  following  description for the
                 -Mnostddef option).  Since all  -D  options  are
                 processed  before  all -U options, the -U option
                 override -D options.  NOTE:  ANSI  C  predefined
                 macros  can be defined and undefined on the com-
                 mand line, but not with  #define  and  #undefine
                 directives in the source.
                 ence.

       --use_pch Use a  pre-compiled header file of the specified 
                 name  as part  of the  current compilation.   If
                 --pch   (automatic  PCH  mode)  appears  on  the 
                 command-line  following this option,  its effect 
                 is erased.

       --[no_]using_std 
                 (Disable)    Enable  implicit  use  of  the  std 
                 namespace   when   standard   header  files  are 
                 included. --using_std is the default.

       -V        Display version messages and other  information.

       -v        Verbose  mode.   Print  out the command line for
                 each tool before it is executed.

       -Wpass,option[,option...]
                 Pass the options to the  specified  pass.   Each
                 comma-delimited  option  is passed as a separate
                 argument.  The passes are: 0 for the compiler, a
                 for the assembler, and l for the linker.

       -w        Do not print warning messages.

       -Xlevel   Specify  the  degree of ANSI C conformance.  The
                 level argument can be either a or c { a | c }.

                 a    Use ANSI mode.  The compiled language  con-
                      forms to all new ANSI features.

                 c    Use  the  conformance  mode.   The compiled
                      language conforms to ANSI C,  but  warnings
                      may be produced about some extensions.

                 s    The compiled language conforms to K&R C.

                 t    The  compiled  language  conforms to K&R C.
                      The  compiler  may  produce  warnings   for
                      semantics  where ANSI C and K&R C conflict.

       -Xm       Allow dollar signs ($) in names.

       -Ypass,directory
                 Look in directory for pass pass, rather then  in
                 the standard area.  The passes are:

                 0         Search   for  the  pgc  executable  in
                           directory.

                 a         Search for the assembler executable in
                           directory.

                 l         Search  for  the  linker executable in
                           directory.

                 S
                           Search for the startup object files in
                           directory.

                 L         If the linker supports the -YL option,
                           then pass the option -YL,directory  to
                           the  linker.  Otherwise, use directory
                           as the standard library location.
                           then  pass the option -YU,directory to
                           the linker.  Otherwise this option  is
                           ignored.

                 I         Set  the  compiler's  standard include
                           directory to directory.  The  standard
                           include  directory is set to a default
                           value by the driver and can  be  over-
                           ridden by this option.

       -y        Arguments are passed to the linker.

       -Mpgflag  Request  PGI-specific actions from the compiler.
                 Many of pgflags optionally begin with  no  (e.g.
                 [no]list).   If the default of such an option is
                 the no variant, this is indicated by no  appear-
                 ing in bold italics as in [nnoo]list.  The permit-
                 ted pgflags are:

                 anno      Produce  annotated   assembly   files,
                           where  source  code is intermixed with
                           assembly language.   -Mkeepasm  or  -S
                           must be used as well.

                 [no]asmkeyword
                           (Don't)  allow  the  asm  keyword in C
                           source   code.    The    format    is:
                           asm("<text>")

                 [no]bounds
                           Enable  (disable)  array bounds check-
                           ing.  Bounds checking is  not  applied
                           to a subscripting pointer.

                 [no]builtin
                           (Don't)  Do  compile with math subrou-
                           tine  builtin  support,  which  causes
                           selected  math  library routines to be
                           inlined.

                 cache_align
                           Align  unconstrained  data  objects of
                           size greater than or equal to 16 bytes
                           on cache-line  boundaries.   An uncon-
                           strained object is a variable or array
                           that  is  not a member of an aggregate
                           structure  or  common  block,  is  not
                           allocatable,  and is not an automatic
                           array.

                 chkfpstk  Check  for internal consistency of the
                           IA-32 FP stack in the  prologue  of  a
                           function  and  after  returning from a
                           function  or  subroutine call.  If the
                           PGI_CONTINUE  environment  variable is
                           set,  the  stack will be automatically
                           cleaned  up and execution will contin-
                           ue.  There  is  a  performance penalty
                           associated  with  stack  cleanup.   If
                           PGI_CONTINUE  is  set  to verbose, the
                           stack will be automatically cleaned up
                           and  execution  will  continue after a
                           warning message is printed.

                 chkstk    Check  the  stack  for available space
                           upon entry to and before the start  of
                           a  parallel  region.  Useful when many
                           private variables are declared.

                           which the compiler  determines  to  be
                           parallelizable.    When  linking,  the
                           -Mconcur switch must be  specified  or
                           unresolved references will occur.  The
                           NCPUS  environment  variable  controls
                           how  many  processors  will be used to
                           execute   parallelized   loops.    The
                           options can be one or more of the fol-
                           lowing:

                           altcode[:n]
                                     Instructs  the  parallelizer
                                     to generate alternate scalar
                                     code for parallelized loops.
                                     If   altcode   is  specified
                                     without arguments, the  par-
                                     allelizer    determines   an
                                     appropriate  cutoff   length
                                     and generates scalar code to
                                     be  executed  whenever   the

                                     equal to  that  length.   If
                                     altcode:n  is specified, the

                 inline[=option[,option,...]]
                           Pass  options to the function inliner.
                           The options are:

                                     A numeric option is  assumed
                                     to  be  a  size.   Functions

                                     statements  are inlined.  If
                                     both number and function are
                                     specified,   then  functions

                           levels:number
                                     number of levels of inlining
                                     are  performed.  The default

                           and link the program.  This is  mainly
                           for use in compiler performance analy-
                           sis and debugging.

                 neginfo=option[,option]...
                           Instructs  the  compiler  to   produce

                 noopenmp  When the option -mp is present, ignore
                           the OpenMP pragmas.

                           gram.  The normal predefined macro is:
                           -Dunix.

                           for include files when those files are
                           not found elsewhere.

                 nostdlib  Do  not link in the standard libraries
                           when linking a program.

                 nostartup Do not link in the usual startup  rou-

                           Set profile options. Normally, the  -q
                           or -p switches are used for this; how-
                           ever, on some systems, it is desirable
                           to override the default method of pro-

                           has the potential to  greatly  enhance
                           the  performance  of  code, especially
                           floating point oriented loops.  Combi-

                                     and arrays) are assumed  not
                                     to  overlap or conflict with
                                     other data objects  and  are

                           (Don't)  suppress  the  ANSI-specified
                           conversion of  float  to  double  when
                           passing  arguments  to a function with
                           no prototype in scope.   -Msingle  may
                           result in faster code when single pre-
                           cision is used a lot, but is  non-ANSI
                           compliant.

                           (Don't)  sign  extend when a narrowing
                           conversion  overflows.   For  example,
                           when  -Msignextend is in effect and an
                           integer containing the value 65535  is
                           converted to a short, the value of the
                           short will be -1.  This option is pro-
                           vided  for  compatibility  with  other
                           compilers, even though ANSI  C  speci-
                           fies  that  the result of such conver-
                           sions are undefined.  -Msignextend  is
                           the default.

                 uchar     Treat   plain   char  declarations  as
                           unsigned char declarations.  Also  see
                           the -Mschar option.

                 unroll[=option [,option...]]
                           Invokes  the loop unroller.  This also
                           sets the optimization level  to  2  if
                           the  level is set to less than 2.  The
                           option is one of the following:

                           c:m       Instructs  the  compiler  to
                                     completely unroll loops with
                                     a constant loop  count  less
                                     than  or  equal to m, a sup-
                                     plied  constant.   If   this
                                     value is not supplied, the m
                                     count is set to 4.

                           n:u       instructs  the  compiler  to
                                     unroll u times, a loop which
                                     is not completely  unrolled,
                                     or  has  a non-constant loop
                                     count.  If  u  is  not  sup-
                                     plied, the unroller computes
                                     the number of times a candi-
                                     date loop is unrolled.

                 nounroll  Instructs  the  compiler not to unroll
                           loops.

                 vect[=option[,option,...]]
                           Pass options to the  internal  vector-
                           izer.  If no option list is specified,
                           then the  following  vector  optimiza-
                           tions     are    used:    assoc,cache-
                           size:262144.  The vect options are:

                           assoc     Instructs the vectorizer  to
                                     enable certain associativity
                                     conversions that can  change
                                     typical  optimization  is to
                                     change an arithmetic  opera-
                                     tion to an arithmetic opera-
                                     tion that is  mathematically
                                     correct, but can be computa-
                                     tionally different,  due  to
                                     round-off error.

                           noassoc   Instructs  the vectorizer to
                                     disable  associativity  con-
                                     versions.

                                     Instructs   the  vectorizer,
                                     when performing cache tiling
                                     optimizations,  to  assume a
                                     cache size of number.

                           sse       Instructs  the vectorizer to
                                     search  for loops, and where
                                     possible,  generate calls to
                                     equivalent  hand-tuned func-
                                     tions  which use the Pentium
                                     III instructions.

                           nosse     Instructs  the vectorizer to
                                     disable  the  recognition of
                                     SSE-equivalent loops.

DIAGNOSTICS

       The compiler produces information and error messages as it
       translates  the  input  program.  The linker and assembler
       may issue their own error messages.
